The terk.jar gets created in this directory.  You can create it by calling "ant build-finch-applications-terk-jar" which
won't do anything if the jar already exists.  To force it to be recreated, use "ant force-build-finch-applications-terk-jar".

Since the terk.jar is generated, it should NOT be checked in to SVN.
