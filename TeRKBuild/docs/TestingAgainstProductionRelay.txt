RUNNING A CLIENT AND (SIMULATED) ROBOT USING THE PRODUCTION RELAY
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To run the client and robot using the production relay, you'll need to build the code to point at the production relay.
Currently, the only remote relay supported by the build process is the one running on lion-o.terk.ri.cmu.edu.  This is
the "prod" build target.  Users who have obtained the source code by downloading a snapshot from the TeRK web site may
use either of the following two commands to build the code:

   ant clean dist

   ant -Dbuild.target=prod clean dist

Users who have obtained the source code by checking it out from SVN must use the second command.

Once you successfully build the client and (simulated) robot code, you can run them on your local machine by doing the
following:

0) Open 2 command prompt windows

1) In the first window, set the current directory to TeRKRobot/dist/commandline

2) In the second window, set the current directory to TeRKClient/dist/commandline

3) Start up a (simulated) robot by running either the CommandLineQwerk.bat (Windows) or CommandLineQwerk.sh (Linux)
   script in the first command prompt window.  When prompted to login, enter the robot's ID number and password.  You
   can use the login for any robot which appears on the "Manage Your Robots" page on the TeRK web site
   (http://www.terk.ri.cmu.edu/managePeers.php).  Create a Fake Qwerk login if necessary.

4) Start up the command line TeRK client by running either the CommandLineClient.bat (Windows) or CommandLineClient.sh
   (Linux) script in the second command prompt window.  When prompted to login, enter your username and password for the
   TeRK web site (http://www.terk.ri.cmu.edu/).

5) The TeRK client has a menu which should explain the available options.  Once you've established a connection between
   the client and the robot, you should be able to send text messages back and forth.

To see a GUI TeRK client and GUI Qwerk, follow the steps above but make the following changes:

Step 1: In the first window, set the current directory to TeRKRobot/dist/fakeqwerk

Step 2: In the second window, set the current directory to TeRKClient/dist/diffdrive

Step 3: For the simulated robot, use either the FakeQwerk.bat (Windows) or FakeQwerk.sh (Linux) scripts (use the same
        login as you did above).

Step 4: Start up the TeRK client using either the DiffDriveClient.bat (Windows) or DiffDriveClient.sh (Linux) scripts
        (use the same login as you did above).

Step 5: The GUI should be pretty intuitive.  Click the Connect button or choose the "Connect Via Relay..." menu item
        to connect to a robot.  Once connected, you can "drive" the robot by clicking on the arrows with the mouse or
        using the arrow keys on your keyboard.  Hold down SHIFT and use the arrow keys to control the camera.
