RUNNING A CLIENT AND (SIMULATED) ROBOT USING YOUR LOCAL RELAY
-------------------------------------------------------------

Once you successfully build the code, you can run it on your local machine (assuming you did a "dev" build) by doing the
following:

0) Open 4 command prompt windows

1) In the first 2 command prompt windows, set the current directory to TeRKRelay/dist

2) In the 3rd window, set the current directory to TeRKRobot/dist/commandline

3) In the 4th window, set the current directory to TeRKClient/dist/commandline

4) In the first window, start the relay using the appropriate script for your platform (either Relay.bat or Relay.sh).
   You should see a few dozen lines of log messages during startup (mostly from Hibernate, the ORM framework we use).

5) Once the relay has started up (it should only take a couple seconds), start the Glacier2 server by running either the
   Glacier.bat or Glacier.sh script in the 2nd command prompt window.

6) Start up a (simulated) robot by running either the CommandLineQwerk.bat or CommandLineQwerk.sh script in the 3rd
   command prompt window.  Log in with a qwerk username and password (you might have to create one first).

7) Start up the command line TeRK client by running either the CommandLineClient.bat or CommandLineClient.sh script in
   the 4th command prompt window.  Log in with a client username and password (you might have to create one first--make
   sure the client has access to the qwerk!).

8) The TeRK client has a menu which should explain the available options.  Once you've established a connection between
   the client and the robot, you should be able to send text messages back and forth.

To see a GUI TeRK client and GUI Qwerk, follow the steps above but make the following changes:

Step 2: In the 3rd window, set the current directory to TeRKRobot/dist/fakeqwerk

Step 3: In the 4th window, set the current directory to TeRKClient/dist/diffdrive

Step 6: For the simulated robot, use either the FakeQwerk.bat or FakeQwerk.sh scripts (the login is the same).

Step 7: Start up the TeRK client using either the DiffDriveClient.bat or DiffDriveClient.sh scripts (the login is the
        same).

Step 8: The GUI should be pretty intuitive.  Click the Connect button or choose the "Connect Via Relay..." menu item
        to connect to a robot.  Once connected, you can "drive" the robot by clicking on the arrows with the mouse or
        using the arrow keys on your keyboard.  Hold down SHIFT and use the arrow keys to control the camera.
