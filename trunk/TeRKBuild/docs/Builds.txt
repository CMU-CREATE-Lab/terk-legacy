BUILDING THE CODE
-----------------

NOTE: Depending on your snapshot of the code (e.g. checked out from SVN or downloaded from the TeRK web site), the
values of the build target variables may differ.

For example, users who have downloaded the source from the TeRK web site will notice that all three build targets
("dev", "test", and "prod") have the same values because those users will always want to use the production relay.

Users who have checked the source out of SVN will see different values for the three build targets since they may either
be developing locally, for the test environment, or for production. The simple rule of thumb is that if you're not
running your own relay server locally, then you'll want to use the production relay, so you'll want to always build
using the "prod" target.

BUILDING THE SOURCE CODE
------------------------

This module provides an easy way to build all the code.  You can of course still build code for a single module by just
cd'ing to the root of that module and typing the appropriate Ant command (and most modules let you build only part of
the code, if you wish--run the "ant -p" command to see a list of all commands supported by that build script).

There are two Ant targets you'll want to use in this module's build script:

   clean

      This target calls the "clean" target on all the TeRK modules.

   dist

      This target calls the "dist" target on all the TeRK modules.

To do a (clean) build for your local development enviroment, do the following:

   ant clean dist

Which is the same as (since the default build target is "dev"):

   ant -Dbuild.target=dev clean dist

Here's an example of creating a build for the test environment:

   ant -Dbuild.target=test clean dist

That command first cleans all the TeRK modules and then calls dist on each one, specifying the "test" build target.

Here's an example of creating a build for the production environment:

   ant -Dbuild.target=prod clean dist

That command does the same as the previous one, but builds for the "prod" build target.

The only supported build targets are "dev" (the default), "test", and "prod".  A build number may optionally be
specified when building.  If unspecified, the build number defaults to the value in the TeRKBuild/build.number.txt file.
Here's an example of specifying the build number:

   ant -Dbuild.target=prod -Dbuild.number=42 clean dist

JAVADOCS
--------

To generate javadocs, simply run "ant javadoc" at the root of any module.  For example, running it at the root of
TeRKClient will generate only the TeRKClient javadocs.  Running it at the root of TeRKBuild will generate all the
javadocs by calling "ant javadoc" on each of the other modules.  You can find the generated javadocs in
MODULE_NAME/dist/javadoc.
